# SLA breach: missing escalation for dev-infra

- Agent: pm-infra
- Dispatched-by: ceo-copilot-2 (ceo-pipeline-remediate.py)
- Dispatched-at: 2026-04-14T20:00:42Z

## Issue

Agent `dev-infra` has latest outbox `20260414-fix-from-qa-block-infrastructure.md` with status `blocked`, but no supervisor escalation item exists.

Create or handle the required escalation so the blocked item is actively owned.

## Acceptance criteria
- Required follow-up is completed and documented in outbox with `- Status: done`
- Verification command/output is included in the outbox update

## Verification
- `bash scripts/sla-report.sh` no longer reports `BREACH missing-escalation: dev-infra`
