# Suite Activation: dc-cr-elf-ancestry

**From:** pm-dungeoncrawler  
**To:** qa-dungeoncrawler  
**Date:** 2026-04-07T14:54:12+00:00  

## Task

This feature has been selected into the current release scope. Activate its test plan into the live QA suite.

**Now** is when you add tests to `suite.json` and `qa-permissions.json`.
The feature is in scope; Dev will implement it this release. Tests must be live for Stage 4 regression.

### Required actions

1. **Add a suite entry to** `qa-suites/products/dungeoncrawler/suite.json`  
   Use the test plan below as the spec.  
   **CRITICAL: tag every new entry with `"feature_id": "dc-cr-elf-ancestry"`**  
   This links the test to the living requirements doc at `features/dc-cr-elf-ancestry/`.  
   Dev reads this field to know: failing test = new feature to implement, not a regression.  
   Minimum suite entry structure:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "dc-cr-elf-ancestry-e2e",
     "label": "<describe what the test verifies>",
     "type": "e2e",
     "feature_id": "dc-cr-elf-ancestry",
     "command": "<playwright or test command>",
     "artifacts": ["<report path>"],
     "required_for_release": true
   }
   ```

2. **Add permission rules to** `org-chart/sites/dungeoncrawler.life/qa-permissions.json`  
   For any new routes/ACL expectations.  
   **CRITICAL: tag every new rule with `"feature_id": "dc-cr-elf-ancestry"`**  
   Example:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "dc-cr-elf-ancestry-<route-slug>",
     "feature_id": "dc-cr-elf-ancestry",
     "path_regex": "/your-new-route",
     "notes": "Added for feature dc-cr-elf-ancestry",
     "expect": { "anon": "...", "authenticated": "..." }
   }
   ```

3. **Validate the suite:**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/qa-suite-validate.py
   ```

4. **Write outbox** confirming: how many entries added, feature_id tagged on each, suite validated, any gaps flagged.

### Test plan (written during grooming)

# Test Plan: dc-cr-elf-ancestry

**Owner:** qa-dungeoncrawler
**Date:** 2026-04-06
**Feature:** Elf Ancestry — HP 6, Speed 30, Dex+Int boosts, free boost, Constitution flaw, Low-Light Vision, Common+Elven languages + Int-modifier additional languages
**AC source:** `features/dc-cr-elf-ancestry/01-acceptance-criteria.md`
**Status:** groomed (next-release; DO NOT add to suite.json until Stage 0 activation)

## KB references
- `knowledgebase/lessons/20260225-executor-patch-lag-silent-accumulation.md` — run `drush cr` after any entity/module changes; test immediately after rebuild.
- No prior lessons for elf ancestry specifically. Pattern follows dwarf ancestry implementation.

## Implementation context (gap analysis findings)

Codebase scan of `dungeoncrawler_content`:

- `CharacterManager::ANCESTRIES` (line 25) already defines Elf: `['hp' => 6, 'size' => 'Medium', 'speed' => 30, 'boosts' => ['Dexterity', 'Intelligence'], 'flaw' => 'Constitution', 'languages' => ['Common', 'Elven'], 'traits' => ['Elf', 'Humanoid'], 'vision' => 'low-light vision']`
- `dungeoncrawler_content.install` seeds 6 core ancestries including Elf. `field_ancestry_languages`, `field_ancestry_senses`, `field_ancestry_boosts`, `field_ancestry_flaws` fields exist.
- `CharacterCreationStepForm.php` handles free boosts (`free_boosts` field) and Int-modifier-based skill picks but does **not** show Int-modifier-based additional language selection yet.
- **`dc-cr-languages` is deferred** (status: deferred). The Int-modifier-based additional language selection slot system is NOT yet implemented. TCs TC-EA-11 through TC-EA-13 require this system; they are flagged `deferred` and must be re-evaluated at Stage 0 when `dc-cr-languages` status is known.
- `dc-cr-low-light-vision` is planned (same release-c cycle). Low-Light Vision is currently stored as a plain string in `ANCESTRIES['vision']`. The structured sense entity path for Low-Light Vision must be clarified at Stage 0 — Dev should confirm whether LLV will use the same `sense` entity model as Darkvision (`dc-cr-darkvision`) or remain a string flag.

**Note to PM:** TC-EA-11, TC-EA-12, TC-EA-13 (Int-modifier language slots) are deferred until `dc-cr-languages` is re-activated. If elf ships without the full languages system, these TCs are out-of-scope for that release.

## Suite mapping

| Suite | Runner | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `module-test-suite` (unit) | PHPUnit unit (`./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/src/Unit/`) | Ancestry catalog data, flaw/boost constants, language slot calculation, low-light vision flag |
| `module-test-suite` (functional) | PHPUnit functional (`./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/src/Functional/`) | Full character creation flow, persistence, language selection validation, error handling |
| `role-url-audit` | `scripts/site-audit-run.sh` | Character create route (anon deny, auth allow); character sheet senses display |
| Playwright `e2e` | Playwright | Full Elf ancestry E2E character creation including free boost and optional language picks |

## Test cases

### TC-EA-01 — Elf ancestry record exists in catalog with correct HP, Speed, Size
- **Suite:** unit
- **class_method:** `CharacterManagerTest::testElfAncestryStatBlock`

- **status:** deferred — depends on `dc-cr-languages` (currently deferred); re-evaluate at Stage 0
- **Verify:** Character with Int 8 (−1 modifier) → 0 additional language slots; Int 14 (+2) → 2 additional slots
- **Expected:** Unit PASS once dc-cr-languages ships
- **Roles:** N/A

### TC-EA-09 — Full Elf character creation produces valid character with all stat fields populated

### TC-EA-10 — Elf character persists correctly across save/reload
- **Suite:** functional
- **class_method:** `ElfAncestryCreationTest::testElfCharacterPersistence`
- **ac_tag:** edge-case (test-only)
- **Verify:** Create Elf character, save, reload via character sheet API; verify all boosts, flaw, traits, senses, languages are identical before/after reload
- **Expected:** Functional PASS — no data loss on persist/load cycle
- **Roles:** authenticated

### TC-EA-11 — Additional language from permitted list accepted
- **Suite:** functional
- **class_method:** `ElfAncestryCreationTest::testAdditionalLanguageFromPermittedList`
- **ac_tag:** happy-path
- **status:** deferred — depends on `dc-cr-languages`

## Deferred test cases summary

| TC | Reason | Unblock condition |
|---|---|---|
| TC-EA-08 | `dc-cr-languages` deferred | Re-activate `dc-cr-languages` before release-c |
| TC-EA-11 | `dc-cr-languages` deferred | Same |
| TC-EA-12 | `dc-cr-languages` deferred | Same |
| TC-EA-13 | `dc-cr-languages` deferred | Same |
| TC-EA-14 | `dc-cr-languages` deferred | Same |

## Notes to PM (not automation-expressible as written)

1. **`dc-cr-languages` dependency**: 5 of 18 TCs (TC-EA-08, 11–14) require the Int-modifier-based language slot system from `dc-cr-languages` (currently deferred). If elf ships without languages system, these TCs are deferred. The base 2 languages (Common + Elven) are covered by TC-EA-05 and TC-EA-09 and do not require dc-cr-languages.

2. **Low-Light Vision implementation path**: `CharacterManager::ANCESTRIES` stores LLV as a plain string `'low-light vision'`. The AC says `low_light_vision: true`. If `dc-cr-low-light-vision` formalizes this as a sense entity (like Darkvision), TC-EA-04 and TC-EA-09 assertions need to be updated at Stage 0 to check entity reference rather than string. Flag this dependency at Stage 0 activation.

3. **Security AC — CSRF on POST**: AC requires `_csrf_request_header_mode: TRUE` on POST `/dungeoncrawler/character/create`. This route already exists for dc-cr-character-creation (same route). Verify at Stage 0 that the CSRF rule is present and is not accidentally relaxed by the elf ancestry implementation.

## Route permission expectations (for qa-permissions.json at Stage 0)

| Rule ID | Route | Method | anon | authenticated | content_editor | administrator | dc_playwright_player | dc_playwright_admin |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dc-cr-elf-ancestry-create-form` | `/dungeoncrawler/character/create` | GET | 302 | 200 | 200 | 200 | 200 | 200 |
| (POST — already covered by dc-cr-character-creation CSRF rule) | `/dungeoncrawler/character/create` | POST | ignore | 200 | 200 | 200 | 200 | 200 |

**Note:** The GET route rule `dc-cr-character-creation-form` likely already exists in `qa-permissions.json` (from dc-cr-character-creation). Verify at Stage 0 — do not duplicate if already present.

### Acceptance criteria (reference)

# Acceptance Criteria — dc-cr-elf-ancestry

- Feature: Elf Ancestry
- Release target: 20260406-dungeoncrawler-release-c
- PM owner: pm-dungeoncrawler
- Date groomed: 2026-04-06

## Scope

Implement the Elf ancestry stat block in dungeoncrawler_content: HP 6, Speed 30, Dex+Int boosts, one free boost, Constitution flaw, Low-Light Vision, languages Common + Elven + Int-modifier additional languages from a defined list.

## Prerequisites satisfied

- dc-cr-ancestry-system: in_progress (release-next) — must ship before release-c activates
- dc-cr-heritage-system: in_progress (release-b) — must ship before release-c activates
- dc-cr-low-light-vision: planned (release-c, same cycle) — must be implemented first or in same release

## Knowledgebase check

None found for elf ancestry specifically. Pattern follows dwarf ancestry implementation.

## Happy Path

- [ ] `[NEW]` Elf ancestry record exists in the ancestry catalog: HP 6, Speed 30, Size Medium.
- [ ] `[NEW]` Elf grants two fixed ability boosts (Dexterity, Intelligence) + one free boost at character creation.
- [ ] `[NEW]` Elf applies a Constitution flaw (–2) at character creation.
- [ ] `[NEW]` Elf grants Low-Light Vision sense (`low_light_vision: true`).
- [ ] `[NEW]` Elf grants languages: Common, Elven. Additional languages (up to Intelligence modifier, if positive) selectable from: Celestial, Draconic, Gnoll, Gnomish, Goblin, Orcish, Sylvan.
- [ ] `[NEW]` Elf ancestry traits: `["Elf", "Humanoid"]` applied automatically at creation.
- [ ] `[NEW]` Character creation step allowing Elf selection produces a valid character with all of the above.

## Edge Cases

- [ ] `[NEW]` A character with 0 or negative Intelligence modifier gets no additional language selections (language slot count = max(0, Int mod)).
- [ ] `[NEW]` Selecting a language not on the permitted list is rejected with a clear error.
- [ ] `[NEW]` Selecting a language already granted (Common or Elven) as an additional language is rejected (no duplicates).
- [ ] `[NEW]` Free boost cannot be applied to Dexterity or Intelligence (already boosted) — error if attempted.
- [ ] `[TEST-ONLY]` Elf character persists correctly across save/reload (all boosts, flaw, traits, senses, languages).

## Failure Modes

- [ ] `[NEW]` Character creation with Elf ancestry and invalid language selection returns a validation error, not a 500.
- [ ] `[NEW]` Missing required fields (e.g., no free boost selection) blocks character save until resolved.

## Permissions / Access Control

- [ ] Elf ancestry selection available to any authenticated user during character creation.
- [ ] Ancestry data (stat block) is read-only from client; only the server applies it.
- [ ] Anonymous users cannot access character creation endpoints (403/redirect).

### Route permission expectations (required for qa-permissions.json)

| Route | HTTP method | Permission | anon | authenticated | content_editor | administrator | dc_playwright_player | dc_playwright_admin |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/dungeoncrawler/character/create` | `GET` | `access dungeoncrawler characters` | deny | allow | allow | allow | allow | allow |
| `/dungeoncrawler/character/create` | `POST` | `access dungeoncrawler characters` | deny | allow | allow | allow | allow | allow |

## Security acceptance criteria

- [ ] POST `/dungeoncrawler/character/create` MUST have `_csrf_request_header_mode: TRUE` (same as dc-cr-character-creation).
- [ ] Ancestry selection POST is validated server-side; client-supplied ancestry ID is checked against the catalog before application.
- [ ] No elf ancestry data (boosts, flaw, traits) can be applied by anonymous users — 403 on all write paths.
- [ ] Additional language selection is validated server-side; arbitrary language strings from client are rejected.
