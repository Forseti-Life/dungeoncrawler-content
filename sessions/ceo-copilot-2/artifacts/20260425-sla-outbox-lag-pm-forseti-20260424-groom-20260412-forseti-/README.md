Follow up with the owning seat, unblock it, or resolve the stale item.

## Acceptance criteria

- Verification command/output is included in the outbox update

## Verification
- `bash scripts/sla-report.sh` no longer reports `BREACH outbox-lag: pm-forseti inbox=20260424-groom-20260412-forseti-release-s`
